Task:
-----

Take an array and remove every second element out of that array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

```
my_list = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
my_arr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...]
myArr = ['Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', 'Remove', 'Keep', ...];
```

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

Example:

```
removeEveryOther(['Hello', 'Goodbye', 'Hello Again']),['Hello', 'Hello Again']);
removeEveryOther([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]),[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]);
removeEveryOther([[1, 2]]), [[1, 2]]);
removeEveryOther([['Goodbye'], {'Great': 'Job'}]),[['Goodbye']]);
removeEveryOther([]), []);
```
