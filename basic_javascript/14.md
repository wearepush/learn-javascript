Task:
-----

Given two numbers and an arithmetic operator (the name of it, as a string), return the result of the two numbers having that operator used on them.

`a` and `b` will both be positive integers, and `a` will always be the first number in the operation, and `b` always the second.

The four operators are "add", "subtract", "divide", "multiply".

A few examples:

    arithmetic(5, 2, "add")      => returns 7
    arithmetic(5, 2, "subtract") => returns 3
    arithmetic(5, 2, "multiply") => returns 10
    arithmetic(5, 2, "divide")   => returns 2.5


    -- In Haskell:

    -- 1. The operation is defined as
    data Operation = Add | Divide | Multiply | Subtract deriving (Eq, Show, Enum, Bounded)

    -- 2. The arithmetic function as
    arithmetic :: Double -> Double -> Operation -> Double
    arithmetic :: Fractional a => a -> a -> Operation -> a


    Kata.Arithmetic(5, 2, "add")      => 7
    Kata.Arithmetic(5, 2, "subtract") => 3
    Kata.Arithmetic(5, 2, "multiply") => 10
    Kata.Arithmetic(5, 2, "divide")   => 2.5


Try to do it without using if statements!
