Task:
-----

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

Examples:
---------

"Should work for under 3 days:"
  rentalCarCost(1) => 40
  rentalCarCost(2) => 80

"Should work for under 7 days:"
  rentalCarCost(3) => 100
  rentalCarCost(4) => 140
  rentalCarCost(5) => 180
  rentalCarCost(6) => 220

"Should work for 7 or more days:"
  rentalCarCost(7) => 230
  rentalCarCost(8) => 270
  rentalCarCost(9) => 310
  rentalCarCost(10) => 35
